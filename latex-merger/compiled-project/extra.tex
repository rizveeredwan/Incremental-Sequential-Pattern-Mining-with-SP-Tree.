\subsection{Complexity Analysis}
In this section, we will try to provide an upper bound estimation about space and runtime of our proposed solutions. It is difficult to provide the exact complexity because of having different types of parameters, e.g., input threshold, data characteristics, etc. For both solutions, first we will introduce the used terminologies, then the upper bound complexities along with a small description about the reduction from the upper bounds. 

\subsubsection{Tree-Miner with SP-Tree}
We have tried to maintain the consistency in variables declaration throughout the study. In Table \ref{table:variables_complexity_tree_miner}, we have listed down the essential and additional variables used in this discussion. In Table \ref{table:space_complexity_tree_miner} and Table \ref{table:runtime_complexity_tree_miner}, we have summarized our discussion to indicate memory and runtime complexity for the proposed static solution respectively. We have shown the upper bound values and practically the value is much lesser due to different criterion.

\subsubsection{IncTree-Miner with IncSP-Tree}
Similar to previous discussion, the additional variables to discuss the upper bound complexity of the proposed incremental solution is stated in Table \ref{table:variables_complexity_inc_tree_miner}. The upper bound space and runtime complexities of our incremental solution along with a discussion about the possibilities of reduced complexities in average scenarios is stated in Table \ref{table:space_complexity_inc_tree_miner} and \ref{table:table_complexity_incremental}, \ref{table:runtime_complexity_inc_tree_miner} respectively. If, we want to store the projection information in the BPFSP-Tree, we need to store the support and projection nodes for each pattern and in the memory resilient version, we just only store the support information. In Table \ref{table:table_complexity_incremental}, we have shown the runtime upper bound complexities of different types of projection cases. Our incremental algorithm first perform projection in the modified subtrees, tests the infrequent to frequent property and based on that perform projection in the unmodified subtrees. The complexities mainly reduce by identifying the infrequent patterns early through breadth-first technique.

\subsection{Points related to implementation}
In this section, we are going to highlight some important points related to the implementation. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item To implement the $next\_link$ and $modified\_next\_link$ attribute we can follow the approach showed in Fig. \ref{figure:next_link_implementation}(b). Here, we have shown how using two pointers (start and end) and maintaining side links we can implement the above mentioned attributes. 
    \item For $parent\_info$ attribute we have used bit based implementation by ordering and indexing the items. We can also use unordered version (not scaling from 0) with some additional memory usage. We can also use vector based implementation of $parent\_info$ but will loose the efficiency gain from bit operations. 
    \item We use $item\_freq$ attribute to apply the implementational pruning strategy stated in lemma \ref{lemma:loop_reduction}. We can remove this attribute to save some memory with some efficiency loss. 
    \item We have also discussed our memory resilient version to save the memory usage for memory constraint environment with additional time expense. 
    \item As, we discover the patterns in depth-first manner, we do not need to have all the frequent patterns (incremental solution) in main memory. Rather we can only load a partial portion from BPFSP-Tree and run the algorithm. We can also use same node references to represent multiple patterns' projections. 
\end{itemize}

So, in summary, our proposed solutions are highly flexible and we can tweak different parts of it based on the requirements and constraints.
